# Safety & academic integrity policy

## Core safety commitments

`canvas-ai` is built to keep users in control of high-risk actions.

1. No hidden auto-submit behavior
2. Explicit submit confirmation (`--confirm`) required
3. Fresh review token (`--confirm-token`) required
4. Local run history for traceability
5. Deterministic error model for safe automation

## Human responsibility

You are responsible for all content produced and submitted through the CLI.

Before submitting, confirm that you:

- Understand the assignment prompt
- Can explain and defend the final content
- Verified citations and factual claims
- Comply with your institution's policy

## Academic integrity expectations

Use this tool for support, not substitution.

Acceptable patterns typically include:

- planning and outlining
- revision support
- rubric self-checking

High-risk or disallowed patterns may include:

- submitting generated text you do not understand
- bypassing explicit instructor restrictions
- presenting AI output as entirely original work where prohibited

When policy is unclear, follow the stricter interpretation and ask your instructor.

## Product constraints

- `submit` currently uses a stubbed submission response in this codebase version.
- Safety controls remain active regardless of submission transport maturity.
